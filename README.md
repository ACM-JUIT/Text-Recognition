# Hand-Written-Text-Recognition

## About: 
This project is the Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) system implemented with TensorFlow or SimpleHTR. The Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) system is implemented with TensorFlow (TF) and trained on the IAM off-line HTR dataset. This Neural Network (NN) model recognises the text contained in the images of segmented words.

## This a "learn and apply" project
You'll learn about the domains that are needed for this project in the first and second weeks, then construct a script and model in the third week, and then rectify and fix problems or increase accuracy in the fourth week.
